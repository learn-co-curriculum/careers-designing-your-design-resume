# Designing Your Resume

**Software Selection**

You’ll likely lean on using **Sketch** since it’s what you’re most familiar with, and you can get your resume looking good with some finesse. Other programs you can use if you have them, are **Illustrator** and **InDesign**, which is part of the Adobe CC applications. You should have access to them with your educational discounted membership without any additional cost. InDesign was built specifically for text layout since it’s geared toward publishing but don’t feel like you need to learn InDesign just for your resume. Google Documents given some adjustments can also be used but generally have less layout flexibility. Remember whatever you select will need to be used or translatable in the future. 

**Layout**

Set up your resume file to 8.5x11” **the standard letter size at portrait layout** and set margins to 0.25” on all sides. Don’t set your resume in any dimensions other than letter-sized or any smaller margins than 0.25”. Employers may print your resume and so the file should be printer-safe, meaning text will get cut off if it’s too close to one edge of the page. 

Additionally, during setup, don’t forget to **select and use a grid.** Don’t use only one column in your layout as it’s been proven harder to read. This forces the reader’s eye to move across the page and back, over and over, which is tiring. And it usually leaves a lot of awkward white space if text lines don’t go all the way across the page. Always use multiple columns. Your reader will thank you, and it allows you more flexibility in laying out various sections.

**Visual Hierarchy Is Important**

Use headers, sub-headers, bold text, italicized text, text size variance, indents, bullets, icons, and other visual or formatting elements to explain levels of importance and take readers through various parts of the document.

**White Space Is Your Friend**

Don’t attempt to fill up the page. Employers can tell when you do that, and it reflects very poorly on you. As an entry-level designer, they know you’re not likely to have much previous experience. So it’s better to have a well-designed resume than a full-looking one. This is important for both UX and UI designers.

**Text Sizes**

Since typefaces can vary by x-height and scale, it’s important to keep text sizes in mind as you design. Header text can be larger but doesn’t really need to be dramatically larger than the main text size. 12pt is generally too large for main text relevance of which font is chosen; for many typefaces even 10pt can still be too large. Thin, narrow fonts usually require a slightly larger size to be readable. Wider, rounded fonts force generally need to go smaller. Design accordingly and your best bet is to print out a draft to review text size.

**Widows and Orphans**

If you don’t remember what these are, [give it a review](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Widows_and_orphans) and make it a point to check for widows and orphans as you are designing out your resume. They make for odd spacing and the eye is drawn to these singular words on your page, making an unnecessary distraction for your reader.

**The One Page Rule**

Once you begin laying out your resume, don’t forget to think about keeping everything to one page. Most of the time you may be fine but if you are finding it difficult to fit everything, you will need to edit and pare down along with make adjustments in the design. You can try a different layout and decreasing the font size a little, not to a point it’s hard to read but enough to get what you need into your resume. 

If you find you still need more room, just end the work experience with a mention that the full history can be found on LinkedIn. Ensure you are still presenting the best pieces of information here on your resume. 

Any further edits to the content itself should be reflected in your Google Doc, that way you have a working text copy for your records. 

If you find there is **too much space on the one page**, it’s time to experiment with column widths and font sizes or consider adding more detail to your job and client projects. Avoid making elements extraordinarily large to fill the space. Resist the urge to make your name or header section gigantic. Aim for a balanced hierarchy and a level of subtlety and refinement when it comes to your personal branding.

**Branding and Color**

Once you have settled on a layout, you’ll want to pull in your personal branding to tie your resume to the rest of your design presence. Use the color palette you plan on using for your portfolio site as that is an extension of your personal brand. Any large deviations from your portfolio site may feel like an inconsistent experience. A resume can definitely be designed in black and white but if you choose to use color, lean on a palette of colors that complement each other and are an extension of your portfolio and personal brand. This could mean a subtle minimum use of color or something bolder. Are there textures, patterns or images you want to leverage? Lean on your understandings of color theory and visual design basics to guide you on your design decisions. Whatever you decide, ensure it’s in line with your personal brand and what you want hiring managers to walk away with. And before you get too far, make sure the color choices you make for your resume prints well in black and white mode on a standard printer. 

**Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**

Nowadays, larger companies are using applicant tracking systems to screen resumes to narrow down which resumes will then be read by real people like recruiters or hiring managers. If you are planning to apply at a company that may use ATS rather than a direct application, you may want to consider a few aspects as you create your resume or even create a fully ATS friendly version to use for these particular situations.

Consider the following ATS friendly guidelines when designing your resume: graphics, tables and certain content located in headers or footers of a document can be difficult for the application tracking system to read or translate into text; ATS are many times looking for matching keywords between the resume and the job description. Using a site such as [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/) can be helpful in determining which keywords to use to make your resume more ATS friendly.

If you decide to create an ATS friendly version, we suggest also including a link to your portfolio that can also showcase a fully designed resume. For a comprehensive guide and recommendation on creating and optimizing a resume that will pass applicant tracking systems, read [Optimizing Resume for ATS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r7fSSJOFFiGy9FdatgILCAV5QQogwtdOS91kfORZxwA/edit).

**Final Reviews**

In theory, you’ve already proofread it many, many times before laying it out and similarly, you’ve laid out the text as it was written exactly in the Google Document but because you may have made adjustments along the way, proofread it one more time in the final designed format. Look at content, grammar, spelling, alignment, size, relationships, hierarchy, spacing, color and other writing and design considerations. Additionally, it may be prudent for an extra pair of eyes to review it.
